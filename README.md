# OpenRocket extensions

Java programs extending Openrocket to support the [MATLAB library](https://github.com/RIT-Launch-Initiative/lmatlib/).

## Installation instructions
1. Download `OpenRocketExtensions.jar` from Releases to the same directory as the `OpenRocket.jar` used by MATLAB. This may require a download to a user directory (`Downloads` or similar) then copying to the installation if your browser is unable to download to protected folders.
2. Run `openrocket_setup` from the latest version of the MATLAB library. No warning should be produced; if it is, make sure `openrocket_setup` is called with the correct directory and that `OpenRocketExtensions.jar` has the correct name under that directory.
